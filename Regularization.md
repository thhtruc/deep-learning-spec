# Regularization

### 1. Regularization:
- This is a technique which makes slight modifications to learning algorithms such that the model generalizes better --> avoid overfitting
a. L1&L2 regularization:
Adding another term as regularization: Cost function = Cost function + regularization
  - L1 regularization: absolute distance
  - L2 regularization: euclidean distance
b. L2 regularization:
c. Dropout regularization:
