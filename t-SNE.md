# **t-SNE**

- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised, non-linear technique
  - used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data.
  - preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities

How t-SNE works?
The t-SNE algorithm calculates a similarity measure between pairs of instances in the high dimensional space and in the low dimensional space. It then tries to optimize these two similarity measures using a cost function.
1. Measure similarities between points in the high dimensional space using Gaussian distribution
